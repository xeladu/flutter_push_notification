# Content

The repository contains a Flutter app with a cloud function to send and receive push notifications. The backend is hosted with Firebase, but it needs to be configured. The code in this repo doesn't work out of the box!

▶ Create a Firebase project and activate the "Blaze" plan.<br/>
▶ Link your Flutter app with the Firebase project, deploy the cloud function, and you're done!
